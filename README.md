React captures the form data and sends it via an HTTP request through the routing process.
Express.js receives the request at an API endpoint.
Node.js executes the backend logic for managing API requests and database collections.
JavaScript processes the chemical data and runs prediction algorithms through Google REST and Twitter APIs. 
MongoDB stores the experiment data and retrieves historical patterns in a BSON Document.
The prediction result is sent back to React and displayed.
HTML/CSS renders the formatted prediction on the screen
